## Paper Speed Model

### Description
This speed model bases off on 3 data parameter given by the paper ["Application of social force model to pedestrian behavior analysis at signalized crosswalk"](). The 3 parameters we changed were relaxation time, desired speed, and maximum crossing speed. We set a minimum speed to set bounds of the range of speed.

| Parameters      | unit    |
| --------------- | ------- |
| min speed       | 1 m/s   |
| max speed       | 1.8 m/s |
| desired speed   | 1.6 m/s |
| relaxation time | 2 s     |
